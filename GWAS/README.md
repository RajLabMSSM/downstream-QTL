# Working with GWAS

## Rationale

Brian and Jack are attempting to maintain a database of all useful GWAS for the lab. This is mostly Neurological and Neuropsych disorders, plus some immune and other traits.

## Methodology

The idea is that we download the raw summary stats to Minerva. We then enter the details of the GWAS and the file to the database.

Using the database we can then preprocess the GWAS summary statistics. Right now this involves sorting and tabix indexing for random access, but could expand to lift over, allele flipping etc.


## Applications of processed GWAS

Again, using the database we can then perform various tasks with the GWAS summary stats, including:

* Fine-Mapping with echolocatoR

* Colocalisation analysis with COLOC

* LD-score regression, mediation analysis, TWAS and so much more.


## Summary

Indexing a GWAS in the database and pre-processing it is the start of a beautiful and well-organised science adventure for the whole lab to enjoy!
