* Colocalisation with GWAS results (COLOC)

* Pairwise sharing between QTLs (qvalue_sharing, pisquared)

* Random-effects meta-analysis of multiple QTL datasets (METASOFT)

* Multivariate adaptive shrinkage for sharing of effect sizes between QTL datasets (MASHR)

* Building Transcriptome-wide Association Study models and applying them to GWAS (TWAS) - under construction

* Fine-mapping using the echolocatoR pipeline (Fine-mapping)
